Invalidity of Conflicting Exclusive Agreements. Any exclusive licensing agreement entered into by the Creator with a third party in respect of the Content, without the prior written consent of the Company, shall be deemed null and void to the extent that such agreement restricts, interferes with, or prevents the exercise of the License or the OTT exploitation of the Content on the Tubi Platform during the Term of the License.
Content Modifications and Derivative Works. The Creator hereby expressly authorizes the Company (and its sublicensees, including the Tubi Platform) to edit, modify, cut, adapt, reformat, censor, or otherwise alter the Content, in whole or in part, solely as reasonably necessary to comply with the creative, technical, advertising, branding, and content suitability requirements of the Tubi Platform, including without limitation the removal of third-party advertising, promotional integrations, branding references, or other elements deemed non-compliant by the Tubi Platform. The Creator acknowledges and agrees that any such edited, modified, or adapted versions of the Content shall be deemed part of the Content and covered by the License, and shall not be considered new or separate works requiring any additional permissions, approvals, or compensation. 
Trademark License. The Creator grants to the Company a non-exclusive, transferable  and sublicensable as defined below license during the Term to use the Creator’s trademarks, trade names, service marks, design, logo, domain name and other indicator of the source or origin of any product or service (collectively, the “Creator Marks”) in connection with the Company’s use and promotion of the Content and promotion of the Company and the ScaleLab brand (for example, including the Creator Marks in partner lists and presentations, marketing and sales materials, financial reports).
Waiver of Moral Rights. The Creator hereby waives or represents that it has obtained a written waiver by the sole or each creator of the Content of, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all rights of paternity, integrity, attribution, disclosure, withdrawal, and any other rights that may be known as ‘moral rights’ (“Moral Rights”) with respect to the use of the Content pursuant to this Agreement.

Music Rights (Sync + Master). The Creator represents and warrants that all music contained in the Content is fully cleared for commercial OTT/AVOD distribution and that the Creator holds both synchronization rights (sync rights) and master recording rights (master rights). The Content shall not include any music licensed solely for use on YouTube or subject to platform-limited or non-OTT licenses.
No Removal Requests. The Creator shall not request or require the removal of the Content from the Tubi Platform during the Term of the License. 
Cooperation on Claims and Rights Clearance. The Creator shall promptly notify the Company of any actual or threatened claim concerning the Content and shall provide reasonable cooperation in resolving such matters. The Creator shall be responsible for resolving claims arising from the Creator’s failure to clear rights in the Content and shall indemnify the Company for losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from such claims.
Promotional Obligations. Within thirty (30) days following the premiere of the Content on the Tubi Platform, the Creator shall post at least one promotional announcement on the Creator’s YouTube channel and at least one on another social media platform. Thereafter, the Creator shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue promoting the availability of the Content on the Tubi Platform in cadence with the Company’s promotional strategy. All promotional postings, materials, messaging, and participation in social activities shall be made in a manner and format to be mutually agreed upon by the Creator and the Company in order to comply with the promotional requirements of the Tubi Platform.
Delivery Materials. The Creator shall deliver to the Company, in a timely manner and in the formats required by the Company and/or the Tubi Platform, all Delivery Materials. For the avoidance of doubt, Delivery Materials include, without limitation, video masters, audio masters, subtitles and/or closed captions (if available), artwork, synopses, metadata, cast and crew information, cue sheets, and any other materials reasonably requested by the Company to enable delivery and distribution of the Content. 
Costs of Corrective Work. If the Creator fails to provide complete and compliant Delivery Materials, or if any corrections, replacements, or supplemental materials are required to meet the technical or legal delivery specifications of the Tubi Platform, the Company may perform such corrective work or engage third parties to do so, and the Company shall have the right to deduct all reasonable costs associated therewith from the Remuneration payable to the Creator.
Accuracy of Information. The Creator represents that all personal, tax, banking, contact, and ownership information provided to the Company is accurate and shall promptly update the Company in the event of changes.
Tax Documentation. The Creator shall provide all tax forms reasonably requested by the Company (including W-8 or W-9 forms, as applicable) and acknowledge that the Company may withhold taxes as required under U.S. tax law.
Compliance with Laws and Policies. The Creator shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies relating to the exploitation of the Content on OTT/AVOD platforms, including policies and guidelines issued by the Tubi Platform.
REMUNERATION
As consideration in full for the rights granted herein, upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Creator remuneration (royalty) in the amount of and payable as follows:
(a) the Creator’s remuneration is 50% of any income obtained by the Company from the use, commercialization, and monetization of the Content on Tubi Platform, unless another amount is agreed upon by the Parties in the Creator’s User Account (the “Remuneration”);
(b) the Remuneration accrual period shall be set at one (1) calendar month (the “Remuneration Accrual Period”). If the Content use period is shorter than the Remuneration Accrual Period, the Remuneration shall be accrued according to the time of actual use of the Content; and
(c) the Creator may select the Remuneration payment type in their User Account. The Creator’s Remuneration payment transaction shall take place in compliance with the payment particulars provided by the Creator in their User Account.
Remuneration Information. Within ninety (90) calendar days of the month following the Remuneration Accrual Period, the Company shall provide relevant analytics and information on the Remuneration accrued for the Creator in their User Account.
Payment Terms and Payout Conditions. The Company shall pay the Creator the Remuneration no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the end of the applicable Remuneration Accrual Period, provided that the corresponding income has been actually received by the Company from the Tubi Platform and the Creator has submitted complete and valid tax documentation (W-8 / W-9, as applicable) and payment information. For the avoidance of doubt, if the amount of income payable by the Tubi Platform to the Company for any monthly period is less than Two Hundred Fifty US Dollars (US$250), the Tubi Platform does not release such payment to the Company due to Tubi’s minimum payout threshold, and therefore no Remuneration shall be payable to the Creator for that monthly period. In such a case, the Remuneration shall automatically accumulate and become payable in the next payment cycle after the Company actually receives the corresponding payment from the Tubi Platform. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have no obligation to pay the Creator any amounts that have not been actually received by the Company from the Tubi Platform.
Fees and Taxes. Each party shall independently undertake the payment of their respective applicable taxes payable under this Agreement. The Creator, independently and incurring all applicable expenses, shall pay any bank-related commission rates and fees related to the payment system of their choice selected through their User Account. The Company may withhold  taxes imposed on or with respect to the Creator’s Remuneration as required under U.S. tax law.
Fulfillment of Payment Obligations. The Company’s payment obligation shall be rendered fulfilled at the time of sending (withdrawal from the Company’s account) the appropriate Remuneration to the Creator using the payment information provided by the Creator in their User Account.
CONFIDENTIALITY
Confidential Information. Each party (the “Receiving Party”) acknowledges that, in connection with this Agreement, it will gain access to information that is treated as confidential by the other party (the “Disclosing Party”), including information about its business affairs, confidential intellectual property, trade secrets, third-party confidential information, financial terms and conditions of cooperation between the parties, including details of any royalty (or other) payments made to the Creator by the Company, and other sensitive or proprietary information, including business operations and strategies, marketing, creative elements, artwork, visual representations, research material and data, specifications, processes, and technological developments, whether orally or in written, electronic, or other form or media, and whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified as ‘confidential’ (collectively, “Confidential Information”).

Confidentiality Obligations. The Receiving Party shall: (i) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially reasonable degree of care; (ii) not use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or permit it to be accessed or used, for any purpose other than to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement; and (iii) not disclose any such Confidential Information to any person or entity, except: (a) to the Receiving Party's officers, employees, agents, consultants, and legal advisors who need to know the Confidential Information to assist the Receiving Party, or act on its behalf, to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under the Agreement, or (b) pursuant to applicable federal, provincial, municipal, or local law or regulation, or a valid order issued by a court or governmental agency of competent jurisdiction, provided that the Receiving Party shall first make commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Disclosing Party with: (1) prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek, at its sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy; and (2) reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, in opposing such disclosure or seeking a protective order or other limitations on disclosure.
